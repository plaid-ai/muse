# Muse Backend API

This directory contains the source code for the Muse backend API.

It is built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+.

The API is responsible for:
* Handling requests from the frontend (`web/`).
* Processing input lecture text.
* Interacting with configured AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT-4o) via their APIs.
* Generating structured study notes (summaries, key points, details).
* Potentially managing user data and notes storage in the future.

## Getting Started (Placeholder)

(Instructions on how to set up the Python environment (e.g., using `venv`), install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`), configure API keys (via `.env`), and run the development server (e.g., `uvicorn main:app --reload`) will be added here.)
