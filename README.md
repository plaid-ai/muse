**Muse is an open-source project leveraging cutting-edge AI to help students transform lecture content into organized, insightful, and effective study notes.**

Tired of spending hours re-listening to lectures or deciphering messy notes? Muse aims to automate the tedious parts of note-taking, allowing you to focus on understanding and learning. Simply provide your lecture text (or audio in the future!), and Muse's AI engine will generate structured summaries, identify key points, and provide detailed breakdowns.

## ‚ú® Vision

Our vision is to create an intelligent learning assistant that not only summarizes information but also inspires deeper understanding and critical thinking ‚Äì acting as your personal academic "Muse". We are building this project with an **AI-first, human-oversight** approach, exploring new frontiers in AI-assisted software development itself.

We plan to offer:
*   A robust **open-source version** (self-hostable via Docker).
*   Potentially, a managed **cloud version** for ease of use and additional features (similar to the Dify model).

## üöÄ Key Features (Current & Planned)

*   **AI-Powered Note Generation:**
    *   `üîç Lecture Summary:` Concise overview of the entire lecture.
    *   `üí° Key Points:` Bulleted list of the most crucial concepts and takeaways.
    *   `üìö Detailed Notes:` Structured breakdown of topics and sub-topics with details.
*   **Input:** Currently accepts raw text input.
*   **Output:** Generates notes in clean Markdown format.
*   **Self-Hosting:** Easy deployment using Docker.
*   **[Planned]** Audio Input: Support for uploading audio files (via STT).
*   **[Planned]** Visual Summary: Generation of single-slide visual summaries (SVG).
*   **[Planned]** Community Features: Sharing notes, collaborative feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Initial)

*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
*   **Frontend:** TBD (Likely React/Next.js or Vue/Nuxt.js)
*   **AI Models:** Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet, OpenAI o3-mini-high (See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details)
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose

## üèÅ Getting Started (Self-Hosting with Docker)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/plaid-ai/muse.git
    cd muse
    ```
2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   You'll need API keys for the AI models used (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI). Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` (to be added) and fill in your keys.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your API keys
    ```
3.  **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
4.  Access the application in your browser (default port TBD, e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

*(Note: Detailed setup instructions will be refined as the project progresses.)*
