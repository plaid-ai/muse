# Muse Docker Configuration

This directory contains files related to building and running the Muse application using Docker and Docker Compose.

It typically includes:
* `Dockerfile`(s) for building images for the frontend (`web/`) and backend (`api/`) services.
* `docker-compose.yml` for defining and running the multi-container application stack (API, Web, potentially databases or other services).

The goal is to provide an easy and consistent way to set up and run the entire Muse application for development and deployment.

## Usage

Refer to the main [README.md](../README.md) in the root directory for instructions on how to build and run Muse using Docker Compose.
