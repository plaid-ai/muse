# Muse Frontend (Web Interface)

This directory contains the source code for the Muse web application frontend.

It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a [React](https://react.dev/) framework.

This interface allows users to interact with the Muse backend API to input lecture content, generate study notes, and manage them.

## Getting Started (Placeholder)

(Instructions on how to install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`) and run the development server (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`) will be added here.)
